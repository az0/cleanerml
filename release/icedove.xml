  <!-- Debian has both a long term stable, mature version based on ESR release
and an up to date backported current version of its Icedove rebranding of
Thunderbird.  This cleaner was tested on the latter but it should also work on
the former by extraplolation from the varients that other Linux distributions
have used over time.  As such it should be as reliable as the Thunderbird one.-->
