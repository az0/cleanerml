  cleaned, particularly "gui_view_history": [] which is a 2D array of the 15 most recently opened books. But I'm not
  sure how to use command="json", and afaik there isn't documentation for it yet, so I won't be adding that option.
  Similarly there is "~/.config/calibre/viewer.json" which contains "viewer_open_history": [] -->
